Mr. Doe is a college  student and employed part-time at Quickie Car Wash.    Cash deposits to Mr. Doe’s personal checking account are structured to possibly circumvent federal reporting requirements.  The deposits are  followed by immediate wire transfers to Aussie Bank in Sydney, Australia to a single beneficiary, Jennifer Doe, account #981012345, with an address located in Australia.  Specifically the following activity has been  observed: cash deposits (dates followed by amounts): 03/15/02  $9,950.00; 03/17/02 $9,700.00; 03/18/02 $10,000; total: $29,650.  Wire transfers out (dates followed by amounts): 03/16/02 $9,900.00, 03/18/02  $9,700.00, 03/19/02 $9,900.00.    The volume and frequency of the deposits is not consistent with previous banking transactions conducted by Mr. Doe.  The amounts of currency do not appear consistent with the  customer’s stated employment.  Also, the relationship between the customer and Jennifer Doe and the purpose for the wire activity is unknown.  Therefore, due to the structured cash deposits by the customer on almost consecutive days into the account, and the immediate wire transfer of the funds out of the account to Jennifer Doe, Aussie bank, account  #981012345, Sydney Australia, this SAR is being filed.  Investigation is continuing.  The bank’s financial intelligence unit in Big City, FL, maintains all records related to this SAR\n",

      "This SAR is being filed to summarize suspicious cash deposits and wire transfer activity conducted by John Doe, account #12345678910.  John  Doe has been a bank customer since April 2000.  Mr. Doe is a college  student and employed part-time at Quickie Car Wash.    Cash deposits to Mr. Doe’s personal checking account are structured to possibly circumvent federal reporting requirements.  The deposits are  followed by immediate wire transfers to Aussie Bank in Sydney, Australia to a single beneficiary, Jennifer Doe, account #981012345, with an address located in Australia.  Specifically the following activity has been  observed: cash deposits (dates followed by amounts): 03/15/02  $9,950.00; 03/17/02 $9,700.00; 03/18/02 $10,000; total: $29,650.  Wire transfers out (dates followed by amounts): 03/16/02 $9,900.00, 03/18/02  $9,700.00, 03/19/02 $9,900.00.    The volume and frequency of the deposits is not consistent with previous banking transactions conducted by Mr. Doe.  The amounts of currency do not appear consistent with the  customer’s stated employment.  Also, the relationship between the customer and Jennifer Doe and the purpose for the wire activity is unknown.  Therefore, due to the structured cash deposits by the customer on almost consecutive days into the account, and the immediate wire transfer of the funds out of the account to Jennifer Doe, Aussie bank, account  #981012345, Sydney Australia, this SAR is being filed.  Investigation is continuing.  The bank’s financial intelligence unit in Big City, FL, maintains all records related to this SAR\n",

Specifically the following activity has been \\nobserved: cash deposits (dates followed by amounts): 03/15/02  $9,950.00; 03/17/02 $9,700.00; 03/18/02 $10,000; total: $29,650.

      "Upon reviewing the provided information in the context of the SAR narrative, here are some feedback points, observations on inaccuracies, and suggestions for improvement:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Financial Institution Mapping**:\n",
      "   - In the \"FIs_to_Accts\" mapping, \"Dummy_Bank_1\" is incorrectly associated with Account ID \"12345678910\". According to the narrative, account #12345678910 belongs to John Doe at Aussie Bank, which is a significant discrepancy. The mapping should be as follows:\n",
      "     - \"Aussie Bank\": [\"12345678910\"]\n",
      "     - Note: Remove \"Dummy_Bank_1\" since all accounts mentioned should belong to recognized financial institutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Customers to Accounts Mapping**:\n",
      "   - The \"Customers_to_Accts\" mapping includes an incorrect association for \"Quickie Car Wash\". The organization \"Quickie Car Wash\" is only mentioned as the place of employment for John Doe and is not connected to the account at any financial institution. Therefore, it should not be mapped to any account. The revised mapping should be:\n",
      "     - \"John Doe\": [\"12345678910\"]\n",
      "     - \"Jennifer Doe\": [\"981012345\"]\n",
      "   \n",
      "3. **Account IDs**:\n",
      "   - The identified Account IDs are consistent with the narrative. All account IDs mentioned (i.e., \"12345678910\" and \"981012345\") are accurately captured.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Clarification on the relationship**:\n",
      "   - The narrative discusses the relationship between John Doe and Jennifer Doe but does not provide clarifying details. When mapping customers to accounts, it could be more informative to clarify the relationship (e.g., if they are family members).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Abstracting Dummy Bank**:\n",
      "   - The use of \"Dummy Bank\" may lead to ambiguity. It should be excluded unless it applies to accounts that are indeed not associated with a specific financial institution outlined in the SAR. All accounts should be dedicated to real financial institutions or appropriately categorized.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Consistency Check**:\n",
      "   - Ensure that all account-related details in the mapping are thoroughly checked against the narrative provided. In cases of discrepancies like the one noted above, an update should be made to ensure full alignment with the narrative.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, immediate corrections are necessary for the financial institutions to which the accounts are mapped, as well as for clarifying the involvement of organizations. It is crucial for the accuracy of a SAR that all information reflects the details included in the narrative for effective monitoring and investigation.\n",

Cash deposits to Mr. Doe’s personal checking account are structured to possibly circumvent federal reporting requirements.  The deposits are  followed by immediate wire transfers to Aussie Bank in Sydney, Australia to a single beneficiary, Jennifer Doe, account #981012345, with an address located in Australia.  Specifically the following activity has been  observed: cash deposits (dates followed by amounts): 03/15/02  $9,950.00; 03/17/02 $9,700.00; 03/18/02 $10,000; total: $29,650.

The volume and frequency of the deposits is not consistent with previous banking transactions conducted by Mr. Doe.  The amounts of currency do not appear consistent with the  customer’s stated employment.

Specifically the following activity has been  observed: cash deposits (dates followed by amounts): 03/15/02  $9,950.00; 03/17/02 $9,700.00; 03/18/02 $10,000; total: $29,650.  Wire transfers out (dates followed by amounts): 03/16/02 $9,900.00, 03/18/02  $9,700.00, 03/19/02 $9,900.00.    The volume and frequency of the deposits is not consistent with previous banking transactions conducted by Mr. Doe.  The amounts of currency do not appear consistent with the  customer’s stated employment.  Also, the relationship between the customer and Jennifer Doe and the purpose for the wire activity is unknown.  Therefore, due to the structured cash deposits by the customer on almost consecutive days into the account, and the immediate wire transfer of the funds out of the account to Jennifer Doe, Aussie bank, account  #981012345, Sydney Australia, this SAR is being filed.  Investigation is continuing.  The bank’s financial intelligence unit in Big City, FL, maintains all records related to this SAR  '''  }\n",

Reviews covering the period between January 2 and March 17, 2003, revealed that 13 deposits (consisting of cash, checks, money orders) totaling approximately $50,000 posted to the personal account. Individual amounts ranged between $1,500 and $9,500 and occurred on consecutive business days in several instances. A number of third-party out of state checks and money orders were also deposited into the account. It was further noted that in nine of 13 instances in which cash deposits were made to both accounts on the same day, the combined deposits of cash exceeded $10,000. The bank filed currency transaction reports to the IRS for all aggregate daily transactions exceeding $10,000.\",\n",

A review of deposit activity on the Acme, Inc. account covering the same period revealed 33 deposits (consisting of cash, checks, money orders) totaling approximately $275,000. Individual amounts ranged between $4,446 and $9,729; however 22 of 33 deposits ranged between $9,150 and $9,980. It was further noted that in nine of 13 instances in which cash deposits were made to both accounts on the same day, the combined deposits of cash exceeded $10,000. The bank filed currency transaction reports to the IRS for all aggregate daily transactions exceeding $10,000. A search of the world wide web identified a website for Acme, Inc., which identified the company as a grocery store that provides remittance services to countries in the Middle East that includes Iran (an OFAC blocked country). Contact with the Virginia State Department of Banking indicates Acme, Inc. is not a licensed money wire transfer business. The bank will close this account because of the suspect nature of the transactions being conducted by John Doe.\",\n",
      "    \"3489728\": \"Between January 17, 2003, and March 21, 2003, John Doe was the originator of nine wires totaling $225,000. The wire transfers were always conducted at the end of each week in the amount of $25,000. All of the wires were remitted to the Bank of Anan in Dubai, UAE, to benefit Kulkutta Building Supply Company, account #3489728.\"\n",

The customer, a grocery store and  its owner, are suspected of intentionally structuring cash deposits to  circumvent federal reporting requirements.  The customer is also  engaged in activity indicative of an informal value transfer operation: deposits of bulk cash, third party out of state personal checks and money \\norders, and engaging in aggregate wire transfers to Dubai, UAE.  The type and volume of activity observed is non-commensurate with the customer’s expected business volume and deviates from the normal volume of similar types of businesses located in the same area as the customer.  Investigative activities are continuing. Our bank has elected to \\ndirectly contact law enforcement concerning this matter along with filing this SAR. \\n\\nJohn Doe opened a personal checking account, #12345-6789, in March of 1994.  Doe indicated that he was born in Yemen, presented a Virginia driver\\'s license as identification, and claimed he was the self-employed  owner of a grocery store identified as Acme, Inc.  A business checking  account, #23456-7891, was opened in January of 1998 for Acme, Inc.  \\n   \\nBetween January 17, 2003, and March 21, 2003, John Doe was the  originator of nine wires totaling $225,000.  The wire transfers were always  conducted at the end of each week in the amount of $25,000.  All of the  wires were remitted to the Bank of Anan in Dubai, UAE, to benefit Kulkutta Building Supply Company, account #3489728.   \\n\\nReviews covering the period between January 2 and March 17, 2003, revealed that 13 deposits (consisting of cash, checks, money orders) totaling approximately $50,000 posted to the personal account.  Individual amounts ranged between $1,500 and $9,500 and occurred on consecutive business days in several instances.  A number of third-party out of state checks and money orders were also deposited into the account.\\n\\nA review of deposit activity on the Acme, Inc. account covering the same  period revealed 33 deposits (consisting of cash, checks, money orders) totaling approximately $275,000.  Individual amounts ranged between  $4,446 and $9,729; however 22 of 33 deposits ranged between $9,150  and $9,980.  It was further noted that in nine of 13 instances in which cash deposits were made to both accounts on the same day, the  combined deposits of cash exceeded $10,000. The bank filed currency  transaction reports to the IRS for all aggregate daily transactions  exceeding $10,000. \\n\\nA search of the world wide web identified a website for Acme, Inc., which  identified the company as a grocery store that provides remittance  services to countries in the Middle East that includes Iran (an OFAC blocked country).  Contact with the Virginia State Department of Banking  indicates Acme, Inc. is not a licensed money wire transfer business.

A\\nbottleneck in this pipeline is in retrieving relevant evidence: traditional\\nmethods may surface documents directly related to a claim, but fact-checking\\ncomplex claims requires more inferences. For instance, a document about how a\\nvaccine was developed is relevant to addressing claims about what it might\\ncontain, even if it does not address them directly. We present Contrastive\\nFact-Checking Reranker (CFR), an improved retriever for this setting. By\\nleveraging the AVeriTeC dataset, which annotates subquestions for claims with\\nhuman written answers from evidence documents, we fine-tune Contriever with a\\ncontrastive objective based on multiple training signals, including\\ndistillation from GPT-4, evaluating subquestion answers, and gold labels in the\\ndataset. We evaluate our model on both retrieval and end-to-end veracity\\njudgments about claims. On the AVeriTeC dataset, we find a 6\\\\% improvement in\\nveracity classification accuracy. We also show our gains can be transferred to\\nFEVER, ClaimDecomp, HotpotQA, and a synthetic dataset requiring retrievers to\\nmake inferences.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Aniruddh Sriram</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Fangyuan Xu</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Eunsol Choi</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Greg Durrett</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">EMNLP 2024 FEVER Workshop</arxiv:comment>\\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04657v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04657v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.CL\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"cs.CL\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"cs.AI\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"cs.LG\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n  </entry>\\n  <entry>\\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04601v1</id>\\n    <updated>2024-10-06T19:28:55Z</updated>\\n    <published>2024-10-06T19:28:55Z</published>\\n    <title>ProtocoLLM: Automatic Evaluation Framework of LLMs on Domain-Specific\\n  Scientific Protocol Formulation Tasks</title>\\n    <summary>  Automated generation of scientific protocols executable by robots can\\nsignificantly accelerate scientific research processes. Large Language Models\\n(LLMs) excel at Scientific Protocol Formulation Tasks (SPFT), but the\\nevaluation of their capabilities rely on human evaluation. Here, we propose a\\nflexible, automatic framework to evaluate LLM\\'s capability on SPFT: ProtocoLLM.\\nThis framework prompts the target model and GPT-4 to extract pseudocode from\\nbiology protocols using only predefined lab actions and evaluates the output of\\ntarget model using LLAM-EVAL, the pseudocode generated by GPT-4 serving as a\\nbaseline and Llama-3 acting as the evaluator. Our adaptable prompt-based\\nevaluation method, LLAM-EVAL, offers significant flexibility in terms of\\nevaluation model, material, criteria, and is free of cost. We evaluate GPT\\nvariations, Llama, Mixtral, Gemma, Cohere, and Gemini. Overall, we find that\\nGPT and Cohere is a powerful scientific protocol formulators. We also introduce\\nBIOPROT 2.0, a dataset with biology protocols and corresponding pseudocodes,\\nwhich can aid LLMs in formulation and evaluation of SPFT. Our work is\\nextensible to assess LLMs on SPFT across various domains and other fields that\\nrequire protocol generation for specific goals.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Seungjun Yi</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Jaeyoung Lim</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Juyong Yoon</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">Submitted to 2024 ACL Rolling Review June Cycle</arxiv:comment>\\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04601v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04601v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.CL\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"cs.CL\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n  </entry>\\n  <entry>\\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04452v1</id>\\n    <updated>2024-10-06T11:23:56Z</updated>\\n    <published>2024-10-06T11:23:56Z</published>\\n    <title>MindScope: Exploring cognitive biases in large language models through\\n  Multi-Agent Systems</title>\\n    <summary>  Detecting cognitive biases in large language models (LLMs) is a fascinating\\ntask that aims to probe the existing cognitive biases within these models.\\nCurrent methods for detecting cognitive biases in language models generally\\nsuffer from incomplete detection capabilities and a restricted range of\\ndetectable bias types. To address this issue, we introduced the \\'MindScope\\'\\ndataset, which distinctively integrates static and dynamic elements. The static\\ncomponent comprises 5,170 open-ended questions spanning 72 cognitive bias\\ncategories. The dynamic component leverages a rule-based, multi-agent\\ncommunication framework to facilitate the generation of multi-round dialogues.\\nThis framework is flexible and readily adaptable for various psychological\\nexperiments involving LLMs. In addition, we introduce a multi-agent detection\\nmethod applicable to a wide range of detection tasks, which integrates\\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), competitive debate, and a reinforcement\\nlearning-based decision module. Demonstrating substantial effectiveness, this\\nmethod has shown to improve detection accuracy by as much as 35.10% compared to\\nGPT-4.

However, adding a new link to the network is not trivial: it\\nrequires not only the identification of a suitable pair of source and target\\nentities but also the understanding of the content of the source to locate a\\nsuitable position for the link in the text. The latter problem has not been\\naddressed effectively, particularly in the absence of text spans in the source\\nthat could serve as anchors to insert a link to the target entity. To bridge\\nthis gap, we introduce and operationalize the task of entity insertion in\\ninformation networks. Focusing on the case of Wikipedia, we empirically show\\nthat this problem is, both, relevant and challenging for editors. We compile a\\nbenchmark dataset in 105 languages and develop a framework for entity insertion\\ncalled LocEI (Localized Entity Insertion) and its multilingual variant XLocEI.\\nWe show that XLocEI outperforms all baseline models (including state-of-the-art\\nprompt-based ranking with LLMs such as GPT-4) and that it can be applied in a\\nzero-shot manner on languages not seen during training with minimal performance\\ndrop. These findings are important for applying entity insertion models in\\npractice, e.g., to support editors in adding links across the more than 300\\nlanguage versions of Wikipedia.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Tomás Feith</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Akhil Arora</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Martin Gerlach</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Debjit Paul</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Robert West</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <arxiv:comment xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\">EMNLP 2024; 24 pages; 62 figures</arxiv:comment>\\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04254v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04254v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.CL\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"cs.CL\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"cs.AI\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"cs.IR\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"cs.LG\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"cs.SI\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n  </entry>\\n  <entry>\\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04068v1</id>\\n    <updated>2024-10-05T07:41:17Z</updated>\\n    <published>2024-10-05T07:41:17Z</published>\\n    <title>ECon: On the Detection and Resolution of Evidence Conflicts</title>\\n    <summary>  The rise of large language models (LLMs) has significantly influenced the\\nquality of information in decision-making systems, leading to the prevalence of\\nAI-generated content and challenges in detecting misinformation and managing\\nconflicting information, or \"inter-evidence conflicts.\" This study introduces a\\nmethod for generating diverse, validated evidence conflicts to simulate\\nreal-world misinformation scenarios.
