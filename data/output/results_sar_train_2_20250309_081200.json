        "1234567": "The account #1234567 for Doe\u2019s Auto Sales shows unusual activity characterized by structured cash deposits. On six occasions in June 2003, cash deposits of $9,800 were made, possibly to avoid the filing of a currency transaction report. Deposits were made by John Doe on 06/03, 06/09, and 06/11 at the Happy Valley branch, while Jane Doe made deposits on 06/04, 06/10, and 06/12 at the Main Office branch. Following these deposits, checks for $9,800 were issued and subsequently deposited at XYZ Bank on 06/04, 06/05, 06/10, 06/11, 06/12, and 06/13. The source of the cash is unknown, and this pattern appears to evade the reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act."
