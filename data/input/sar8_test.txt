Bank investigation file number GG123456. This SAR is being filed to summarize suspicious cash deposit and wire transfer activity involving Karen Walker, account number 55443322. Between March 2021 and June 2024, Karen Walker opened four accounts at our brokerage firm’s branch office in Capital City, DC. Ms. Walker was either the joint account holder or had power of attorney on the following accounts: CS 11223 in the name of John Miller; CS 44556 in the name of Emily Turner; CS 77889 in the name of Michael Lewis and Karen Walker; and CS 99001 in the name of Rebecca Adams.

At the time she opened the accounts, Ms. Walker stated that she was a freelance financial consultant. When asked about the reason for the joint accounts, Ms. Walker claimed she was helping her friends and family with their financial planning. Ms. Walker further informed a representative of our investment firm that John Miller was her uncle, Emily Turner was a family friend, Michael Lewis was her business partner, and Rebecca Adams was her sister.

From April 2021 through May 2024, accounts CS 11223, CS 44556, CS 77889, and CS 99001 had total deposits of $1,500,000 and total withdrawals of $1,200,000. The accounts were funded primarily by personal checks issued on an account at ABC Bank in the name of R. Adams, account number 55446677. Most of the withdrawals from the four accounts consisted of checks made payable to 'cash' and endorsed by Ms. Walker and/or the other account holders.

On several occasions, Ms. Walker visited the Capital City Branch office with checks from Ms. Adams’s ABC Bank account, leaving the payee and amount of the checks blank. Ms. Walker then instructed her financial advisor regarding the amount and payee of the checks. The financial advisor filled out those portions of the checks and deposited the checks on behalf of Ms. Walker into the respective brokerage account. When recently questioned about the checking activity in the four accounts by a representative of our brokerage firm, Ms. Walker stated that the funds in the four accounts belonged to her and the withdrawals were made to cover her living expenses. Ms. Walker did not explain why she did not withdraw the cash directly from the ABC Bank account.

A series of six checks were issued from account number CS 11223 on August 10, 2023, August 12, 2023, August 14, 2023, August 16, 2023, August 18, 2023, and August 20, 2023 in the amount of $9,000 each and were made payable to 'Jackson Enterprises, LLC.' When asked about the checks by a representative of our brokerage firm, Ms. Walker stated that she owed money to Jackson Enterprises for consulting services but did not offer an explanation as to why the checks were issued several days apart. In March 2024, Ms. Walker deposited into brokerage account CS 99001 five checks each in the amount of $8,000. The checks were dated March 5, 2024, March 6, 2024, March 7, 2024, March 8, 2024, and March 10, 2024, and were all drawn on an account at XYZ Bank in the name of Mark Brown. When asked about the checks by a brokerage firm representative, Ms. Walker stated that Mr. Brown is a colleague who recently liquidated some assets. Ms. Walker added that she was advised that XYZ Bank would not clear checks quickly if the total amount of checks for one day exceeded $8,000. The financial advisor filled out the payee and amount of the checks.

Our brokerage firm has restricted the accounts from any further activity and is in the process of closing them. The financial advisor, Clark Kent, was terminated from the firm on June 1, 2024. This SAR is filed due to the manner in which Ms. Walker handled transactions through the four brokerage accounts, the volume of funds in and out, especially the checks in August 2023 and the deposits in March 2024, in amounts that indicate possible structuring. All documentation related to this matter is retained in our firm’s compliance office in Capital City, DC. For further information, please contact Compliance Officer, Sarah White, at (555) 321-1234.
