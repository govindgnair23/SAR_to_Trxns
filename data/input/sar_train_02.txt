Doe Auto Sales, commercial checking account #1234567, is being reported for unusual activity and structured cash deposits. Doe Auto  Sales operates as a small used car lot with an inventory of less than 10 vehicles at any given time.  John Doe is the owner of Doe Auto Sales and a signer on the account.  Jane Doe is an additional signer. The account was opened in September 2002 at the Happy Valley branch in  Anytown, CA.  

Account activity is usually extremely limited and several months involve  periods of no account activity.  However, many suspicious and structured transactions were conducted in June 2003 at two different bank branches in Anytown. The cash deposits were conducted in a manner possibly to  avoid filing a currency transaction report.  The structured cash deposits 
were always conducted for $9,800 each.  Immediately following each deposit, a check for $9,800 posted to the account, payable to Doe Auto Sales.  Those checks were deposited to an account at XYZ Bank, also located in Anytown. Structured cash deposits conducted in June 2003  were as follows: 06/03 $9,800; 06/04 $9,800; 06/09 $9,800; 06/10 $9,800; 06/11 $9,800; and 06/12 $9,800.  The deposits on 06/03, 06/09, and 06/11 were completed at the Happy Valley branch by John Doe.  The remaining deposits, on 06/04, 06/10, and 6/12, were conducted by Jane Doe at the Main Office branch.  The source of the cash deposited to the account is unknown.  

Checks posting to the account payable to Doe Auto Sales and deposited at XYZ bank were as follows: 06/04 $9,800; 06/05 $9,800; 06/10 $9,800; 06/11 $9,800, 06/12 $9.800; and 06/13 $9.800.  It is unknown what happened to the funds after the deposits to XYZ Bank. Due to the pattern and manner of recent transactions, it appears that the cash deposits to credit Doe Auto Sales were structured to evade the reporting requirement of the Bank Secrecy Act.  Additionally, the immediate movement of funds out of the bank to another financial institution in amounts slightly below $10,000 seems unusual.  A review of prior transactions since the account opened revealed no similar type of activity or in such amounts.  Therefore, this suspicious activity report is being submitted.  

The bank will continue to monitor the account for further activity and file a  supplemental SAR if required.  
All documentation obtained during this investigation is located in the case file, case #03-501, maintained by the bank's anti-money laundering department.  Additional branch location address: Main Office branch- 100 West Happy Valley Street, Anytown, CA 12345.
