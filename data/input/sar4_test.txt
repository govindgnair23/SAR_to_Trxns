Investigation case number: E6543210. Green Valley Farms, commercial checking account #6543210, is being reported for suspicious financial activity and structured cash deposits. Green Valley Farms is a small agricultural business with a focus on organic produce, operated by Thomas Green, the owner and primary signer on the account. Susan Green is an additional signer. The account was opened in January 2020 at the Elm Street branch in Springfield, IL.

Account activity typically shows regular deposits and withdrawals related to farm operations. However, in April 2024, there were numerous structured transactions conducted at two different bank branches in Springfield. These cash deposits appear to be structured to avoid filing a currency transaction report (CTR). Each deposit was made for $9,900. Immediately following each deposit, a check for $9,900 was posted to the account, payable to Green Valley Farms, and subsequently deposited into an account at PQR Bank, also located in Springfield. Structured cash deposits conducted in April 2024 were as follows: 04/02 $9,900; 04/03 $9,900; 04/10 $9,900; 04/11 $9,900; 04/18 $9,900; and 04/19 $9,900. The deposits on 04/02, 04/10, and 04/18 were completed at the Elm Street branch by Thomas Green. The deposits on 04/03, 04/11, and 04/19 were conducted by Susan Green at the Main Office branch. The source of the cash deposited to the account is unknown.

Checks posted to the account, payable to Green Valley Farms, and deposited at PQR Bank were as follows: 04/03 $9,900; 04/04 $9,900; 04/11 $9,900; 04/12 $9,900; 04/19 $9,900; and 04/20 $9,900. It is unknown what happened to the funds after the deposits to PQR Bank. Due to the pattern and manner of these transactions, it appears that the cash deposits to credit Green Valley Farms were structured to evade the reporting requirement of the Bank Secrecy Act. Additionally, the immediate movement of funds out of the bank to another financial institution in amounts just below $10,000 is unusual. A review of previous transactions since the account opened revealed no similar activity or amounts. Therefore, this suspicious activity report is being submitted.

The bank will continue to monitor the account for further activity and file a supplemental SAR if required. All documentation obtained during this investigation is located in the case file, case #24-987, maintained by the bank’s anti-money laundering department. Additional branch location address: Main Office branch – 1500 West Elm Street, Springfield, IL 62701. For further information, please contact Compliance Officer, Mark Davis, at (555) 432-1098.
