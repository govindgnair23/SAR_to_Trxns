Investigation case number: B7845120. Michael Smith, the owner of XYZ Consulting LLC, is suspected of engaging in suspicious wire transfer activities indicative of potential money laundering. Smith opened a business checking account, #56789-1234, in January 2022, and a personal checking account, #67890-4321. He provided a New York driver’s license for identification and claimed that XYZ Consulting LLC offers consulting services.

Between February 1, 2023, and May 15, 2023, Smith initiated 15 wire transfers totaling $450,000 from the business account and 10 wire transfers totaling $300,000 from his personal account to various foreign accounts in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Switzerland. These transactions were conducted through both online banking and in-person visits to ABC Bank at 123 Main Street, New York, NY. Each transfer was structured just below $50,000 to avoid triggering mandatory reporting requirements.

The volume and frequency of the wire transfers are inconsistent with the expected activity of a consulting business, especially given the lack of corresponding business transactions or invoices. The transfers to multiple foreign accounts without clear business justifications suggest potential money laundering activities. The structuring of amounts just below the reporting threshold indicates an attempt to evade detection.

Smith utilized both online banking and in-person transactions to initiate wire transfers, often visiting the bank to ensure the transactions went through without delays. The funds were moved from the business and personal accounts to several foreign accounts in a pattern suggesting layering to obscure the origin of the funds.

Due to the suspicious nature of the transactions, this SAR is being filed to alert law enforcement to potential money laundering activities. The bank has decided to close both the business and personal accounts of Michael Smith and will continue to monitor any further activity related to XYZ Consulting LLC. All records related to this investigation are maintained at the bank’s compliance office at 123 Main Street, New York, NY.
