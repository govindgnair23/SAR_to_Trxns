Bank investigation file number EE987654. This SAR is being filed to summarize suspicious wire transfer and check cashing activity conducted by Richard Johnson, account number 99887766. On May 20, 2023, DEF Brokerage Firm, Office of Compliance, filed a suspicious activity report for Richard Johnson. In summary, the prior submission reported that during the period of April 1, 2023 through April 25, 2023, Mr. Johnson sent eight wire transfers for amounts just under $10,000 each to his business account in Panama.

After DEF Brokerage Firm management advised the client that they would no longer accept such wire transfer instructions, the client began cashing checks drawn on his DEF Brokerage Firm account at money service businesses (MSBs) in Panama. Specifically, on June 5 and June 6, 2023, the client cashed four checks made payable to an MSB for an aggregate total of $38,000. When asked the reason for preparing and cashing these checks in this manner, Mr. Johnson claimed, in substance, that he did not want to fill out the paperwork required by Panamanian law for cash transactions of U.S. $10,000 or more. The account has been closed. Primary federal regulator – SEC.
