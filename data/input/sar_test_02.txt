Investigation case number: C9876543. ABC Investments LLC and its owner, Sarah Johnson, are suspected of conducting unusual financial transactions indicative of potential money laundering. Sarah Johnson opened a business investment account, #78910-1121, in March 2021 and a personal savings account, #89101-2234, with the same institution. Johnson provided a California driver’s license for identification and stated that ABC Investments LLC specializes in real estate investments.

Between March 1, 2023, and June 20, 2023, Sarah Johnson executed 20 wire transfers totaling $500,000 from the business account and 12 wire transfers totaling $360,000 from her personal account. The wire transfers were directed to multiple accounts in the Cayman Islands, Belize, and Panama. These transactions were processed via both online banking and in-person visits to the DEF Bank located at 456 Elm Street, San Francisco, CA. Each transfer was structured in amounts just under $50,000, seemingly to avoid triggering regulatory reporting requirements.

The volume and pattern of these wire transfers are not consistent with typical activities expected from a real estate investment firm, particularly given the absence of any related business documentation or property transactions. The frequent transfers to offshore accounts without clear business purposes raise significant concerns about possible money laundering activities. The repeated structuring of transfer amounts just below the reporting threshold is suggestive of attempts to evade detection.

Sarah Johnson made use of both online banking and personal visits to initiate the wire transfers, often ensuring the transactions were completed without delays. The funds were systematically transferred from the business and personal accounts to multiple offshore accounts, indicating a pattern of layering to obscure the origin of the funds.

Given the suspicious nature of these transactions, this SAR is being filed to alert law enforcement to potential money laundering activities involving ABC Investments LLC and Sarah Johnson. The bank has decided to close both the business and personal accounts associated with Sarah Johnson and will continue to monitor for any related suspicious activities. All records pertaining to this investigation are kept at the bank’s compliance office at 456 Elm Street, San Francisco, CA.
