Investigation case number: D4567890. Alpha Tech Solutions, commercial checking account #7890123, is being reported for suspicious activity and structured cash deposits. Alpha Tech Solutions is a small IT consulting firm with fewer than 10 employees. Emily Johnson is the owner and primary signer on the account, with David Johnson as an additional signer. The account was opened in April 2021 at the Maple Street branch in Rivertown, NY.

Account activity is typically minimal, with sporadic deposits and withdrawals. However, numerous structured transactions were conducted in May 2024 at two different bank branches in Rivertown. The cash deposits appear to be structured to avoid filing a currency transaction report (CTR). Each structured cash deposit was made for $9,900. Immediately following each deposit, a check for $9,900 was posted to the account, payable to Alpha Tech Solutions, and subsequently deposited into an account at LMN Bank, also in Rivertown. Structured cash deposits conducted in May 2024 were as follows: 05/05 $9,900; 05/06 $9,900; 05/12 $9,900; 05/13 $9,900; 05/19 $9,900; and 05/20 $9,900. The deposits on 05/05, 05/12, and 05/19 were completed at the Maple Street branch by Emily Johnson. The deposits on 05/06, 05/13, and 05/20 were conducted by David Johnson at the Main Office branch. The source of the cash deposited to the account is unknown.

Checks posted to the account, payable to Alpha Tech Solutions, and deposited at LMN Bank were as follows: 05/06 $9,900; 05/07 $9,900; 05/13 $9,900; 05/14 $9,900; 05/20 $9,900; and 05/21 $9,900. It is unclear what happened to the funds after the deposits to LMN Bank. Due to the pattern and manner of these transactions, it appears that the cash deposits to credit Alpha Tech Solutions were structured to evade the reporting requirement of the Bank Secrecy Act. Additionally, the immediate movement of funds out of the bank to another financial institution in amounts just below $10,000 is unusual. A review of previous transactions since the account opened revealed no similar activity or amounts. Therefore, this suspicious activity report is being submitted.

The bank will continue to monitor the account for further activity and file a supplemental SAR if required. All documentation obtained during this investigation is located in the case file, case #24-789, maintained by the bank’s anti-money laundering department. Additional branch location address: Main Office branch – 200 West Maple Street, Rivertown, NY 12345. For further information, please contact Compliance Officer, Lisa Brown, at (555) 876-5432.
