Investigation case number: A5678910. The customer, a grocery store and  its owner, are suspected of intentionally structuring cash deposits to  circumvent federal reporting requirements.  The customer is also  engaged in activity indicative of an informal value transfer operation: deposits of bulk cash, third party out of state personal checks and money 
orders, and engaging in aggregate wire transfers to Dubai, UAE.  The type and volume of activity observed is non-commensurate with the customerâ€™s expected business volume and deviates from the normal volume of similar types of businesses located in the same area as the customer.  Investigative activities are continuing. Our bank has elected to 
directly contact law enforcement concerning this matter along with filing this SAR. 

John Doe opened a personal checking account, #12345-6789, in March of 1994.  Doe indicated that he was born in Yemen, presented a Virginia driver's license as identification, and claimed he was the self-employed  owner of a grocery store identified as Acme, Inc.  A business checking  account, #23456-7891, was opened in January of 1998 for Acme, Inc.  
   
Between January 17, 2003, and March 21, 2003, John Doe was the  originator of nine wires totaling $225,000.  The wire transfers were always  conducted at the end of each week in the amount of $25,000.  All of the  wires were remitted to the Bank of Anan in Dubai, UAE, to benefit Kulkutta Building Supply Company, account #3489728.   

Reviews covering the period between January 2 and March 17, 2003, revealed that 13 deposits (consisting of cash, checks, money orders) totaling approximately $50,000 posted to the personal account.  Individual amounts ranged between $1,500 and $9,500 and occurred on consecutive business days in several instances.  A number of third-party out of state checks and money orders were also deposited into the account.

A review of deposit activity on the Acme, Inc. account covering the same  period revealed 33 deposits (consisting of cash, checks, money orders) totaling approximately $275,000.  Individual amounts ranged between  $4,446 and $9,729; however 22 of 33 deposits ranged between $9,150  and $9,980.  It was further noted that in nine of 13 instances in which cash deposits were made to both accounts on the same day, the  combined deposits of cash exceeded $10,000. The bank filed currency  transaction reports to the IRS for all aggregate daily transactions  exceeding $10,000. 

A search of the world wide web identified a website for Acme, Inc., which  identified the company as a grocery store that provides remittance  services to countries in the Middle East that includes Iran (an OFAC blocked country).  Contact with the Virginia State Department of Banking  indicates Acme, Inc. is not a licensed money wire transfer business.  The 
bank will close this account because of the suspect nature of the transactions being conducted by John Doe.
