Bank investigation file number FF456789. This SAR is being filed to summarize suspicious account activity and wire transfers conducted by Emily Taylor, account number 11223344. Between January 2022 and March 2024, Emily Taylor opened two accounts at our brokerage firm’s branch office in Metropolis, NY. Ms. Taylor was either the joint account holder or had power of attorney on the following accounts: CS 56789 in the name of Linda Davis; and CS 67890 in the name of Robert Davis and Emily Taylor. At the time she opened the accounts, Ms. Taylor stated that she owned a boutique shop in Metropolis. When asked about the reason for the joint accounts, Ms. Taylor stated that she was trying to assist various friends and relatives with their asset management. Ms. Taylor further advised a representative of our investment firm that Linda Davis was her aunt and Robert Davis was her cousin.

In addition to some securities trading, from February 2022 through March 2024, accounts CS 56789 and CS 67890 had total deposits of $1,100,000 and total withdrawals of $950,000. The accounts were funded largely by personal checks issued on an account at XYZ Bank in the name of L. Davis, account number 9988776. The majority of the withdrawals from the two accounts consisted of checks made payable to 'cash' and endorsed by Ms. Taylor and/or the other account holders.

On multiple occasions, Ms. Taylor went to the Metropolis Branch office with checks from Ms. Davis’s XYZ Bank account, in which the payee and amount of the checks were left blank. Ms. Taylor then instructed her financial advisor as to the amount and payee of the checks. The financial advisor filled out those portions of the checks and deposited the checks on behalf of Ms. Taylor into the appropriate brokerage account. When recently asked about the checking activity in the two accounts by a representative of our brokerage firm, Ms. Taylor stated that the funds in the two accounts belonged to her and the withdrawals were made to cover her living expenses. Ms. Taylor did not explain why she did not withdraw the cash directly from the XYZ Bank account.

A series of five checks were issued from account number CS 56789 on January 15, 2023, January 17, 2023, January 18, 2023, January 20, 2023, and January 21, 2023 in the amount of $10,000 each and were made payable to 'Alex Fox, ESQ.' When asked about the checks by a representative of our brokerage firm, Ms. Taylor stated that she owed money to Mr. Fox but did not offer an explanation as to the reason the checks were issued several days apart. In February 2024, Ms. Taylor deposited into brokerage account CS 67890 four checks each in the amount of $7,500. The checks were dated February 3, 2024, February 4, 2024, February 5, 2024, and February 7, 2024, and were all drawn on an account at ABC Bank in the name of George King. When asked about the checks by a brokerage firm representative, Ms. Taylor stated that Mr. King is a fellow boutique store owner who recently sold a property. Ms. Taylor added that she was advised that ABC Bank would not clear checks quickly if the total amount of checks for one day exceeded $7,500. The financial advisor filled out the payee and amount of the checks.

Our brokerage firm has restricted the accounts from any further activity and is in the process of closing them. The financial advisor, Peter Parker, was terminated from the firm on March 29, 2024. This SAR is filed due to the manner in which Ms. Taylor handled transactions through the two brokerage accounts, the volume of funds in and out, especially the checks in January 2023 and the deposits in February 2024, in amounts that indicate possible structuring. All documentation related to this matter is retained in our firm’s compliance office in Metropolis, NY. For further information, please contact Compliance Officer, Michael Lee, at (555) 654-7890.
