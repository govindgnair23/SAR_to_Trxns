Bank investigation file number CC345678. This SAR is being filed to summarize suspicious cash deposit and wire transfer activity involving two corporate customers, Red Horizon LLC and Blue Ocean Inc., both registered in Delaware and sharing a common address at 5678 Market Street, Suite 101, in Wilmington, Delaware. Numerous CTRs have been filed on cash deposits conducted on behalf of these companies. Our previous and recent reviews of the customers’ activities revealed that the cash deposits and wire transfers involving these companies might be consistent with money laundering.

Because the bank was unable to determine any particulars about the companies to establish a business justification for the activity, the following patterns appeared suspicious:

    A repeating pattern of structured cash deposits into business accounts held by the companies with wire transfers to a particular beneficiary.
    Individual transactions conducted in large dollar amounts.
    Individual transactions conducted in even dollar amounts.
    Individual transactions conducted within a short period of time (i.e., daily basis, 2x's daily, every other day).
    Periodic incoming wire transfers from a foreign corporation via a correspondent account maintained by a foreign bank at Coastal Bank.

Specifically, the analysis of the cash deposit and wire activity for the period 1/1/22 through 5/31/24 revealed the following:

    The Delaware companies are as follows: Red Horizon LLC and Blue Ocean Inc., both of 5678 Market Street, Suite 101, Wilmington, Delaware.
    The total number and dollar value of cash deposits into accounts held by the companies are as follows: Red Horizon LLC, account #87654321, 312 deposits totaling $3,200,000; Blue Ocean Inc., account #12345678, 228 deposits totaling $2,450,000. Reviews of the accounts indicate all the deposits were night deposits conducted through three main branches of Coastal Bank: East Wilmington; West Wilmington; and Central Wilmington. The average amount of deposits negotiated through account #12345678 ranged from $9,000 to $17,000. Many of the transactions conducted on the same day at multiple branches in amounts under $10,000 may have been conducted to circumvent federal reporting requirements.
    20 incoming wire transfers were received from GMBH Corporation affecting account #12345678. GMBH Corporation is registered in Germany and is a customer of Bank ABC in Berlin, Germany, account #456789012. Bank ABC maintains a correspondent relationship with the Bank of Germany. The Bank of Germany, in turn, maintains a correspondent account at Coastal Bank. As part of Coastal Bank’s due diligence of foreign wire transactions, we contacted Bank of Germany to have them inquire with Bank ABC about GMBH Corporation. Bank ABC could not substantiate the type of business activity or provide any documentation for GMBH Corporation. Bank ABC’s contact with GMBH Corporation in response to our query resulted in the business closing its account with Bank ABC with no explanation provided.
    The total number and dollar value of outgoing wire transfers from Red Horizon LLC and Blue Ocean Inc. are as follows: Red Horizon LLC, account #87654321, 290 wire transfer debits totaling $3,180,000; Blue Ocean Inc., account #12345678, 210 wire transfer debits totaling $2,435,000. The day after cash deposits, wire transfers were usually conducted through the use of a remote computer terminal as part of an Internet service for the accounts. The amount of wire transfers usually equaled the aggregate of deposits from the day before. All wire transfers from both accounts were remitted to Louis Dupont, Fine Arts Bank, account #789123456, in Geneva, Switzerland.

At the time the accounts were opened with our financial institution, a registered agent for both companies provided corporate filings with the Secretary of State of Delaware indicating the companies are for-profit, engaged in luxury goods trading. As part of our annual review of corporate accounts, we were unable to substantiate if the companies are still active from researching public records, commercial database systems, or the Internet. Attempted telephone contact with the companies identified both numbers as being disconnected. The companies do not appear to maintain operating businesses in Delaware; and there is no indication of legitimate business activity.

Due to these factors and the suspicious nature of the account activity, bank management has decided to end our banking relationships with Red Horizon LLC and Blue Ocean Inc. All records related to this matter are being maintained by the bank’s central branch operations officer in Wilmington, DE.
