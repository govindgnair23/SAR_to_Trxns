Cash deposits to Mr. Doe’s personal checking account are structured to possibly circumvent federal reporting requirements.  The deposits are  followed by immediate wire transfers to Aussie Bank in Sydney, Australia to a single beneficiary, Jennifer Doe, account #981012345, with an address located in Australia.  Specifically the following activity has been 
observed: cash deposits (dates followed by amounts): 03/15/02  $9,950.00; 03/17/02 $9,700.00; 03/18/02 $10,000; total: $29,650.  Wire transfers out (dates followed by amounts): 03/16/02 $9,900.00, 03/18/02  $9,700.00, 03/19/02 $9,900.00.  

The volume and frequency of the deposits is not consistent with previous banking transactions conducted by Mr. Doe.  The amounts of currency do not appear consistent with the 
customer’s stated employment.  Also, the relationship between the customer and Jennifer Doe and the purpose for the wire activity is unknown. 
Therefore, due to the structured cash deposits by the customer on almost consecutive days into the account, and the immediate wire transfer of the funds out of the account to Jennifer Doe, Aussie bank, account  #981012345, Sydney Australia, this SAR is being filed.  Investigation is continuing.
