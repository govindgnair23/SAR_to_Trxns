Bank investigation file number BB98765. This SAR is being filed to summarize suspicious cash deposits and wire transfer activity conducted by Michael Brown, account #987654321. Michael Brown has been a bank customer since June 2015. Mr. Brown is a software engineer working full-time at Tech Innovators Inc.

Cash deposits to Mr. Brown’s personal checking account are structured to possibly circumvent federal reporting requirements. The deposits are followed by immediate wire transfers to EuroBank in Berlin, Germany to a single beneficiary, Anna Schmidt, account #123456789, with an address located in Germany. Specifically, the following activity has been observed: cash deposits (dates followed by amounts): 05/10/23 $9,800.00; 05/12/23 $9,700.00; 05/15/23 $9,900.00; total: $29,400.

The volume and frequency of the deposits are not consistent with previous banking transactions conducted by Mr. Brown. The amounts of currency do not appear consistent with the customer’s stated employment. Additionally, the relationship between the customer and Anna Schmidt and the purpose for the wire activity is unknown.

Therefore, due to the structured cash deposits by the customer on almost consecutive days into the account, and the immediate wire transfer of the funds out of the account to Anna Schmidt, EuroBank, account #123456789, Berlin, Germany, this SAR is being filed. The investigation is continuing.
